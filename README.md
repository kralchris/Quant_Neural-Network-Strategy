# Neural Network Strategy for TSLA

## Overview

This repository implements a sophisticated **Neural Network-based trading strategy** for **Tesla Inc. (TSLA)** using minute-level stock data. The model leverages machine learning techniques, specifically a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), to predict short-term price movements and generate buy/sell signals. The strategy includes a robust **money management system** designed to optimize profitability and mitigate risks during unfavorable market conditions.

## Key Features

- **High-frequency data**: Fetches 1-minute interval stock data for TSLA from Yahoo Finance.
- **Technical Indicators**: Integrates both short-term and long-term moving averages (SMA, EMA) to enhance the decision-making process.
- **Neural Network**: Utilizes a deep learning architecture (MLPClassifier) to predict market direction.
- **Backtesting Framework**: Includes a simulated backtest with portfolio performance visualization, tracking profits and losses over time.
- **Dynamic Risk Management**: Implements a custom money management strategy that adjusts position sizing based on market conditions, aiming to preserve capital during drawdowns.

## Strategy Breakdown

1. **Data Collection**:
    - The strategy fetches **minute-level price data** for TSLA over the last seven days, ensuring real-time analysis and high-frequency trading capabilities.
    
2. **Feature Engineering**:
    - **SMA & EMA**: Calculates the 5-period and 10-period Simple Moving Averages (SMA) and Exponential Moving Averages (EMA), which are key technical indicators used as features.
    - **Return & Direction**: Computes price returns and converts them into binary signals indicating upward or downward trends.

3. **Model Training**:
    - The strategy uses an **MLPClassifier** with a three-layer architecture (100, 100, 50 neurons) to predict the directional movement of the stock price.
    - The neural network is trained on historical features such as price, volume, and technical indicators to recognize patterns and generate predictions.

4. **Money Management**:
    - **Initial Capital**: $10,000.
    - **Investment Strategy**: The system initially invests $1,000, with a position adjustment algorithm based on market predictions. If a prediction results in a loss, the strategy reduces exposure to preserve capital.
    - **Side Bank**: Implements a 'side bank' feature to accumulate funds for risk management during adverse market trends.

5. **Backtesting**:
    - The strategy is backtested using a portion of the historical data, and the performance is visualized by tracking the portfolio value over time.
    - Provides a clear breakdown of the **initial capital**, **final portfolio value**, **net profit**, and contributions from the side bank.

## Results

The strategy's performance is evaluated over a simulated period, with a detailed plot of portfolio growth. Key metrics such as **final balance** and **net profit** are presented, giving a transparent view of the strategy's effectiveness.

## Getting Started
